 <h3 id="about">ABOUT</h3>
 <div>Intrepid Travel has come a long way since its beginnings in 1989. From two university friends, a typewriter and a kitchen desk, it is now a proud member of PEAK Adventure Travel Group Limited, taking over 100,000 travellers every year. 
 Intrepid Travel is part of PEAK’s Intrepid Group of companies, alongside leading small group adventure companies Peregrine, Geckos, Peregrine Reserve, Adventure Tours and The Adventure Company.

 <div>
 Despite growing into a global business with over 1,000 staff based all over the world and over 800 different trips across every continent, we’ve remained devoted to the same grassroots values and responsible travel philosophies that we had at the very beginning. 
&nbsp;</div>
 <div> On every trip we operate and in every interaction we have with a client, supplier or local, we live our core values everyday:
 <p><ul>
		<li>
			Integrity – Doing the right thing</li>
		<li>
			Responsible – Think global, act local</li>
		<li>
			Growth – Stakeholders in our own success</li>
		<li>
			Innovation – Thriving on new ideas and embracing change</li>
		<li>
			Fun – It’s engrained into who we are and what we do</li>

Our travellers have three styles of tour to choose from: Basix, Original and Comfort. Each has a different level of inclusions and accommodation, but all have unforgettable real life experiences as part of the package. Travellers can also choose themed trips, such as Family, Sailing or Food, to suit their interests.
Our group size has an average of just ten travellers, which allows us to get off the beaten track, use local accommodation and transport, and really get to know the culture. It also ensures we are contributing to the local economy; by choosing local suppliers we were able to keep AUD 60 million in local economies in 2012. We’re also working hard to reduce our carbon footprint and were the first in our sector to introduce carbon offset trips. This, along with our many corporate sustainability activities, has meant we’re one of the travel industry’s leaders in responsible travel.
Don’t take our word for it, here some awards we’ve managed to win along the way:

 <h2 id="FAQ">FAQ</h2>

<h3>
	Financial security</h3>
<div>
	<strong>Is Intrepid financially secure?</strong></div>
<div>
	Yes. Intrepid started in 1989 and have been profitable almost every year since 1991. Intrepid have substantial financial reserves that exceed the requirements set down by IATA and Australia&#39;s Travel Compensation Fund. This enables us to cope with major downturns in business such as that which occurred following September 11. See the next question for more information on what happens to your money.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>What happens to my money when I pay for my trip?</strong></div>
<div>
	When Intrepid receives money from either you or from your travel agent, the funds are deposited into a Client Trust Account. The money stays in this account until the day of departure of your trip. Why? So that in the unlikely event of Intrepid ever going broke, your money is still safe and you would get it back in full. Intrepid&#39;s Client Trust Account is independently audited every year in accordance with Australia&#39;s Travel Compensation Fund (TCF) standards. The TCF is a legislated body governing the licensing and operation of travel agents in Australia. Failure to meet financial criteria reflecting the financial viability of a travel agent results in revocation of the agent&#39;s licence to trade. Intrepid are licensed under these arrangements.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Is my travel agent financially secure?&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	It is an unfortunate fact that travel agents do go broke from time to time. If you are using a travel agent, it is your responsibility to ensure that the agent is financially sound. This is important as the agent may hold your money before sending it to us for your trip. Should that agency go broke before we have received your money, then it may be lost. Different countries have different levels of legislation, licences, bonds, trust accounts and/or insurance schemes to protect you. These vary greatly from country to country and some countries have no such protection at all. Please research this carefully to make sure the money you are paying is secure. Where there are no protection systems in your country, at least look at how long the business has been trading, ask others about their reputation and seek independent advice on reputable travel agencies.</div>

<h3>
	The Intrepid Foundation</h3>
<div>
	<p><strong>What is The Intrepid Foundation?</strong><br />
		The Intrepid Foundation (TIF) is a not-for-profit fund that helps bring support to non-government organisations in the places that Intrepid visits. Each year the fund distributes donations from Intrepid and travellers to more than 50 fantastic organisations around the world.</p>
	<p><strong>How did it start?</strong><br />
		Intrepid Travel&#39;s founding Directors, Darrell Wade and Geoff Manchester started TIF in 2002 in response to many travellers asking how they could donate to communities or organisations they had visited with Intrepid. They also really wanted to know that the money would get there and be used effectively, so Darrell and Geoff kicked off The Intrepid Foundation with AU$200,000. Since then, more than AU$3,000,000 has been raised by travellers and Intrepid Travel and distributed to over 75 organisations.</p>
	<p><strong>What kind of organisations does The Intrepid Foundation benefit?</strong><br />
		Organisations working in the areas of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			health care</li>
		<li>
			education</li>
		<li>
			human rights</li>
		<li>
			child welfare</li>
		<li>
			sustainable development</li>
		<li>
			environment</li>
		<li>
			wildlife protection.</li>
	</ul>
	
		<strong>What&#39;s the advantage of a traveller donating to The Intrepid Foundation?</strong><br />
		The Intrepid Foundation is registered as a charity and 100% of donations received are donated to the local beneficiary organisations in an annual grant. Intrepid Travel contributes into the fund also and pays for all the administration costs. You can be assured that your donation will get to the organisation, be used for a significant need and make a real difference, such as pay a nurse&#39;s wage, build a much-needed classroom, pay for 50 students&#39; school fees or help treat injured wildlife.</p>
	<p><strong>How can I donate?</strong><br />
		Then best way is online, with a Visa or Mastercard credit card.<br />
		Your donation and credit card details are secure, and you will receive a receipt immediately.</p>
	<p><strong>Is my donation tax deductible?</strong><br />
		If you are an Australian taxpayer, donations to The Intrepid Perpetual Fund are tax deductible. Donations to the Intrepid Community Project Fund are not tax deductible.</p>
	<p><strong>Can I donate to any local organisation through The Intrepid Foundation?</strong><br />
		No. The Intrepid Foundation offers a selection of organisations that they have come to know well, and have conducted &#39;due diligence&#39; checks to ensure they are well run, trustworthy and do genuinely effective and important work with the money raised.<br />
		We currently have more than 40 beneficiary organisations in over 23 countries. </p>
